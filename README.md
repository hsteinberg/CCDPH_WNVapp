# Cook County Department of Public Health West Nile Virus Surveillance Shiny App
During periods when increased West Nile virus activity is expected (generally from June through October), suburban Cook County's four mosquito abatement districts trap and test mosquitos for West Nile virus. The Cook County Department of Public Health also tests dead birds for West Nile virus and conducts disease surveillance in humans. Surveillance data is compiled into a weekly report and shared with our partners in mosquito control, the healthcare community, and the public. This application is a companion to our weekly report. The app is live here: <https://ccdphcd.shinyapps.io/westnile/>.
