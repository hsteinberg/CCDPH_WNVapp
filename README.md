# Cook County Department of Public Health West Nile Virus Surveillance Shiny App
During periods when increased West Nile virus activity is expected (generally from June through October), suburban Cook County's four mosquito abatement districts trap and test mosquitos for West Nile virus. The Cook County Department of Public Health also tests dead birds for West Nile virus and conducts disease surveillance in humans. Surveillance data is compiled into a weekly report and shared with our partners in mosquito control, the healthcare community, and the public. This application is a companion to our weekly report. 

Data is not included in the repository; however, visitors are welcome to view and borrow code.


The app is live here: <https://ccdphcd.shinyapps.io/westnile/>,  but still under development so errors/inefficiencies might be noted. Feedback to improve the code is welcome.
